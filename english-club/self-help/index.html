The books take their name from Self-Help, an 1859 best-seller by Samuel Smiles, but are also known and classified under &ldquo;self-improvement&rdquo;, a term that is a modernized version of self-help. Self-help books moved from a niche position to being a postmodern cultural phenomenon in the late twentieth century</p></blockquote><ol><li><em>Think and Grow Rich</em> — ~80 million</li><li><em>The Alchemist</em> — ~65 million</li><li><em>You Can Heal Your Life</em> — ~50 million</li><li><em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em> — ~26 million</li><li><em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em> — ~25 million</li><li><em>Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff… and It’s All Small Stuff</em> — ~25 million</li><li><em>Who Moved My Cheese?</em> — ~23 million</li><li><em>The Celestine Prophecy</em> — ~23 million</li><li><em>The Secret</em> — ~20 million</li><li><em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em> — ~20 million</li></ol><ul><li>Out of the 80 million people who bought <em>Think and Grow Rich</em>, how many do you think thought and grew rich?</li></ul><blockquote><p>According to book sales figures from PublishDrive, sales of self-help books more than doubled from 2022 to 2023. Cookbook sales grew by 75 percent during that time, and sales for books focused on enhancing one’s body, mind, and spirit jumped 63 percent.</p></blockquote><p>Do you think self-help books are helpful?

What began as a genuine movement toward holistic health has, in many ways, become <strong>a performance of well-being</strong>, where looking <em>balanced, disciplined, and mindful</em> signals status as much as actually being healthy.</p><h2 id=you-might-be-a-wellness-flexer-if><strong>You might be a wellness flexer if&mldr;</strong></h2><ol><li>You post a photo of your green smoothie with the caption <em>“just nourishing my body”</em></li><li>You&ndash;unprompted&ndash; talk inccessantly about your wellness routine.</li><li>You announce your “digital detox”… on social media.</li><li>You post your Apple Watch stats or sleep score</li><li>You own more than 3 self-help books and promote them to others.</li></ol><h2 id=the-theory-of-the-leisure-class><strong>The Theory of the Leisure Class</strong></h2><p>In his 1899 work <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em>, <strong>Thorstein Veblen</strong> introduced the idea of <strong>“conspicuous consumption”</strong> — the practice of displaying wealth or status through visible consumption of luxury goods and activities. He argued that people use their lifestyle choices not just for utility, but to <strong>signal social position</strong>.</p><p>Wellness culture today often mirrors this same logic. Instead of displaying material wealth through jewels or carriages, many people now display <strong>“cultural capital”</strong> through wellness habits — clean eating, mindfulness, boutique fitness, and minimalist aesthetics. These acts signal not just health, but <strong>time, money, discipline, and moral worth</strong> — modern equivalents of Veblen’s “leisure” indicators.</p><p>In essence, the <strong>wellness flex</strong> has become the new <strong>status symbol</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>“I am calm, balanced, and healthy — because I have the resources and freedom to be.”</p></blockquote><p>Wellness is no longer just about health — it’s about <em>presentation</em>.
Social media platforms, especially Instagram and TikTok, have turned self-care into a <strong>visual lifestyle brand</strong>: green smoothies, yoga retreats, minimalist interiors, and “that girl” morning routines.</p><h2 id=wellness-as-a-consumer-identity><strong>Wellness as a Consumer Identity</strong></h2><ul><li>The wellness industry now represents <strong>a multibillion-dollar market</strong>, selling everything from supplements to luxury meditation apps.</li><li>Health has become <strong>commodified</strong>: instead of inner balance, people purchase products that <em>symbolize</em> wellness — organic foods, skincare routines, and fitness tech.</li><li>This shifts wellness from a mindset to <strong>a consumption-based identity</strong>, where the ability to buy “healthy” or “natural” products signals success.</li><li>The modern wellness elite displays spiritual calm and “self-work” as evidence of superiority.</li></ul><h2 id=the-privilege-gap><strong>The Privilege Gap</strong></h2><ul><li>True wellness requires <strong>time, money, and access</strong> — things not equally distributed.</li><li>Many influencers and brands frame wellness as universally attainable. As a result, wellness becomes <strong>a moral measure</strong>: those who can’t achieve it may be seen as lazy or “unmotivated,” reinforcing class and social divides.</li></ul><h2 id=performance-over-authenticity>Performance Over Authenticity**</h2><ul><li>Online, self-care and wellness often function as <strong>status performances</strong> — curated proof that one is thriving, calm, and in control.</li><li>This performance can paradoxically <strong>increase anxiety</strong>, as people feel pressure to appear well rather than to <em>be</em> well.</li><li>The irony is that wellness, meant to reduce stress, becomes another form of competition and self-surveillance.</li></ul><h2 id=5-from-healing-to-hierarchy><strong>5. From Healing to Hierarchy</strong></h2><ul><li>In essence, wellness culture has drifted from <em>healing</em> toward <em>hierarchy</em>.
Practices that once emphasized inner peace or balance now often serve to <strong>signal sophistication and success</strong>.</li><li>This transformation mirrors the broader self-help industry’s flaws: when personal growth becomes a trend, it risks <strong>reproducing the very insecurities it claims to solve</strong>.</li></ul><h2 id=lets-discuss-1>Let&rsquo;s discuss!</h2><ol><li>What roles do social status and identity play in shaping how people participate in wellness culture?</li><li>How might ideas from Thorstein Veblen’s <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em> help us understand modern approaches to health, mindfulness, and self-care?</li><li>In what ways can self-help and wellness practices both support and complicate genuine self-reflection?</li><li>How does social media influence the ways people express or experience wellness?</li><li>What factors determine who has access to wellness practices, and how might that affect the meanings people attach to them?</li><li>What might distinguish authentic expressions of wellness from those that are more performative or commercialized?</li></ol></div></main><footer><footer><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/years.css></footer></body></html></footer></body></html>
