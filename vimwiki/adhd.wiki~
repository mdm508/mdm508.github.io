== Delay Research ==
While learning something in a book I want to look up more information
or have questions I want answered. This can be distracting from the reading,
stopping looking thing up, no guarantee on when I a coming back. 

And it might turn out I'm not really  interested in this. Just in that moment
I was. So I will try to delay research. Write down the question if you must
and see if its interesting a month from now. If so then research it.
