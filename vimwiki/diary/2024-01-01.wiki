Let's review and focus only on reviewing and nothing else. 
Lost track of time at night time. Was watching that show about Candy Candy.
It like a cinderella story with Ghosts, 3 prince charmings and a horse house.
Going to go out to my room and listen to an audio tape and fall asleep.

Morning meditation consisted of a talk and chanting. It was not very
focused. I want to experiment with a silent meditation after chanting.

Getting sort of unfocused with this wiki. I think you should tone it
down. I'm supposed to be reviewing right now and am instead messing around
in viw wiki.

Now it's 8pm and I am proud to be checking in. I am pretty tired but I want to
relax and read for an hour.

Today I was interupted mid day by an unexpected visit by my dad
& Andy. It was strange that he visited because I just had a dream
about him and Tammy last night.

Andy told me lots of interesting stories. My favorite was about
his wedding day. Apparently his mother in law decided to renew
her vows at the wedding. So they basically had two back to back
weddings.

I might enroll in a Chinese class in S.F. My hope is that doing so
will motivate me to study more and give me a clear path to doing so.
It's easy for me to get distracted and so I want to give myself
motivation to stay with one thing.
