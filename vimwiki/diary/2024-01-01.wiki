Morning meditation consisted of a talk and chanting. It was not very
focused. I want to experiment with a silent meditation after chanting.

Today I was interupted mid day by an unexpected visit by my dad
& Andy. It was strange that he visited because I just had a dream
about him and Tammy last night.

Andy told me lots of interesting stories. My favorite was about
his wedding day. Apparently his mother in law decided to renew
her vows at the wedding. So they basically had two back to back
weddings.

I might enroll in a Chinese class in S.F. My hope is that doing so
will motivate me to study more and give me a clear path to doing so.
It's easy for me to get distracted and so I want to give myself
motivation to stay with one thing.
