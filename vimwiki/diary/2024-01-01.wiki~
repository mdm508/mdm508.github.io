Spend longer then I should have listening to the Michelle Obama's
"Becoming". Made me feel motivated to work hard in my own life.

Going to do brief mediation before the review.

The review brought up a lot of things. I ended up not doing any
of the modules and focused on reflecting on where my ADHD has cause
problems in the past. I had a near 2 hour conversation with Lindsay.
It felt great to be understood. She had some really interesting advice
for me and I came away feeling tired but hopeful. One of her tips was 
to use somatic exercise when feeling stressed. That was a new word for me.

She also had interesting advice about personifying one part of the mind
as a gentle, caring parent, that would talk to their inner child at times
when the inner child is wanting to act up. She talked about how kids 
get out of their beds at night and want to have a glass of milk, go to the
bathroom, or some other array of silly excuses, to avoid having to 
wind down and go to bed.

How it takes time each day to wind down and its better to begin the process
early. 

Most of what she said were things I already knew but it helped to be
reminded of them and hear them offered to me in a different way. 
I sometimes don't value my own ideas and need to hear them from
someone else before I am willing to believe them.

It was a really full day today despite not doing a lot of things. I got a lot
out of my reading. 

Yush and I discussed her starting a game where she could explore her
Grandma's old house. I'm excited to be able to support her in this goal.
The best part is that she will be the leader of this project since it is her
memories after all. I feel like I have been able to contribute a few ideas
without being overbearing. I am proud of myself for that. 

Refactored my goals today. The new list is this

1. Follow the path 
2. Live Healthy 
3. Be iOS Developer 
4. Fluent Chinese 
5. Do math 
6. Play the piano 
7. Read 
8. Financial Awarenes

I hope I spelled everything right.

Got up at 5:30 today. Feeling a bit tired but am hoping to get a lot done 
today. Biggest thing is to finish up doing my yearly review. As I am reviewing
I have a bad habit of doing other things and getting distracted. So when
I am reviewing I want to focus all my attention on the review.

- [X] Complete yearly review.

Let's review and focus only on reviewing and nothing else. 
Lost track of time at night time. Was watching that show about Candy Candy.
It like a cinderella story with Ghosts, 3 prince charmings and a horse house.
Going to go out to my room and listen to an audio tape and fall asleep.

Morning meditation consisted of a talk and chanting. It was not very
focused. I want to experiment with a silent meditation after chanting.

Getting sort of unfocused with this wiki. I think you should tone it
down. I'm supposed to be reviewing right now and am instead messing around
in viw wiki.

Now it's 8pm and I am proud to be checking in. I am pretty tired but I want to
relax and read for an hour.

Today I was interupted mid day by an unexpected visit by my dad
& Andy. It was strange that he visited because I just had a dream
about him and Tammy last night.

Andy told me lots of interesting stories. My favorite was about
his wedding day. Apparently his mother in law decided to renew
her vows at the wedding. So they basically had two back to back
weddings.

I might enroll in a Chinese class in S.F. My hope is that doing so
will motivate me to study more and give me a clear path to doing so.
It's easy for me to get distracted and so I want to give myself
motivation to stay with one thing.
