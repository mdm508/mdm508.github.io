== My knowledge base ==
This area is for storing notes, random thoughts, half baked ideas
and anything else I don't feel like warrants a blog post but
I want to record. 

== Pop up tasks ==
- vim wiki doesnt appear on site
- how do i go up and down in this window.
- no more random tasks use this for random stuff.
- delete sometimes doesnt work in gvim
-
