My goal this week is to improve my speed by continually adding the number 13.</li><li>My 30th is coming up and it would feel great to publish that update before saturday.</li><li>I have woke up for 4am for 5 days in a row. I have been sleeping around 6 hours lately. It is hard to get up but I am always happy I got up later.</li><li>It seems like my ideal morning routine is<ul><li>make your bed</li><li>meditate</li><li>gym</li><li>program iOS</li></ul></li></ul><p>I am struggling to respect my new early bed time. Here I am at 9:46, 46 minutes late. I bought a 12 dollar doraemon alarm clock. You have to manually
set it each night.</p><h4 id=friday>Friday</h4><ul><li>My Grandma stopped by the house and gave me two early birthday presents. A rasberry birthday cake and a pair of cross pens. She remembered that I was upset about loosing the pen my mom gave me! I was not expecting this gift at all but it made me so happy. I will not loose these pens (actually one of them is a mechanical pencil, the other a ball point pen). I won&rsquo;t loose them because I am never going to take them out of the house. They will remain in the same place at all times.</li></ul><h4 id=saturday>Saturday</h4><p>Today I turned 30. I decided to go bowling with my dad, sister, her fiance, and Yush! I didn&rsquo;t like putting my fingers into the holes so I developed a new two handed technique. It is not very accurate but I am able to generate a lot of speed.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_D1a1pBmXg?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><h3 id=march-31---april-6>March 31 - April 6</h3><h4 id=monday-1>Monday</h4><ul><li>Today I spent over 10 hours helping Yush plan a trip to Kyoto.</li><li>I created a custom google map to help reccomend interesting places based on what district she&rsquo;s in.</li><li>Turns out Kyoto has over 1600 temples!<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></li></ul><h4 id=tuesday>Tuesday</h4><p>I’ve been faithfully following my 4am, albeit insane, wake-up routine—but today, I needed a nap. The nap went on too long I actually felt more tired afterward.</p><h4 id=wednesday>Wednesday</h4><ul><li>My dreams were strange. Yush was in the garage in my office but I could not see her. She was a disembodied voice. It felt like the window was talking to me. She was reading math formulas to me in Chinese on a school broadcast system. At some other point I recall being chased by the police. They never caught me.</li><li>I went to the gym in the morning after meditation. I got there at 6am and still couldn&rsquo;t get a prime parking spot.</li><li>I&rsquo;m still procrastinating on iOS but I realized why <code>PersistenceController</code> was not being seen by my main app; I simply forgot to mark each of the files inside the <code>Persistence</code> framework as members of the <code>Persistence</code> target. I had assumed placing the files inside the framework`s folder was enough. Turns out you need to explicitally mark the source file as a member of the target.</li></ul><p><img src=/months/25-03/target.png alt=img1></p><p><img src=/months/25-03/target1.png alt=img2></p><h4 id=thursday>Thursday</h4><ul><li>I read for a few hours and realized that I was craving quality input. Reading was more enjoyable then watching TV or dumb videos online.</li><li>My office is pretty cold given the lack of insulation so I hung up some blankets to create a fort, in hopes to trap the warm air. I think its a failure so far.</li><li>Yush is in Taiwan so I have the house to myself for a month. I&rsquo;d love to use this time to improve my meditation practice. It is really quiet if I don&rsquo;t turn on the radio. I hope to give myself some time to enjoy the silence.</li></ul><h4 id=friday-1>Friday</h4><ul><li>I have still procrastinated on my morning iOS routine. After going to the gym at 530 I feel pretty tired. It might be prudent to go to the gym in the afternoon and protect those precious morning hours for focused work.</li><li>After the gym I stopped by St.Dunstan&rsquo;s Church to practice meditation. I was suprised to find the entire church adorned in purple. People in the front pews of the church was chanting something. I think it might be lent right now. It was a nice space to practice meditation in. It was like 3:00pm and kids were just getting out of class. A few of them went into the church with their mom to pray. In the 9 years I went to that school I cannot recall a single instance of going to Church after school with my mom to pray. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m really catholic anymore, I consider mysef Buddhist, but I decided to try praying and talking with Jesus nonetheless. I said &ldquo;hey, what&rsquo;s up, it&rsquo;s been a while&rdquo;. I was reminded of logging into Wii fitness last year and the screen said &ldquo;it has been 5,208 days since your last workout&rdquo;. I asked Jesus to help me focus, but then I felt bad because I realized that everytime I talked to him I was always asking for stuff. Even when I was a kid. So then I apolagized and told him &lsquo;actually its okay, I dont need anything, i&rsquo;m just saying, whats up". I love the idea of a guardian angel and for better or for worse Jesus has been burned into my memory and is probably the most iconic figure I can think of. So, I guess, I mine as well make use of that. I&rsquo;m trying to personify skillful versions of myself as a guardian angel and I think Jesus is an obvious canidate.</li><li>So in short, going to the Church when no one is there and there is no mass is quite relaxing. I love religous spaces and places of worship. It is also just weird to think that I sat in those same pews not too long ago.</li><li>Then I went to McDonald&rsquo;s bought an iced coffee for $0.99. Starbuck&rsquo;s is too expensive so I decided to read at McDonalds which is conveinently located accross from the church.</li><li>I&rsquo;m realizing that keeping a dream log is basically the same as keeping a real life log. Now I perhaps better understand Zhuangzi&rsquo;s piece about the butterfly.</li></ul><h4 id=weekend>Weekend</h4><ul><li>I finished <em>Source Code</em>!</li></ul><h2 id=april--may>April – May</h2><p>I didn&rsquo;t write at all during April and May so I will just list some bullets of random things.</p><ul><li>Helped tutor for geometry. I had to really intensely review all my highschool geometry and was studying 4 hours or more each day. It felt like I was back in school and was kind of fun. I studied so much that I was dreaming about geometry.</li><li>Yush was gone during April and returned in May. I had lots of alone time.</li><li>I bought a camera and started taking photos. I later found another camera (only for pictures though) in my garage. I want to add more photos to this website and appreciate beauty in the world. I am also interested in learning about photo editing.</li><li>Completed my Chinese class. We performed Cinderella. I wrote a modern adaption of the play where instead of staying in an abusive household, Cinderella leaves and gets a job at a coffee shop. Fast foward 3 years later and she is the manager and going steady with the prince. Here is the <a href=/post/cinderella>Cinderella-script</a></li></ul><h2 id=june>June</h2><h3 id=big-purchases>Big Purchases</h3><p>I spent way too much money this month. I got carried away an bought two typewriters, one electric, one analog. I have been putting them to good use however. The electric one is for journaling and the other for taking notes. Someday I want to get an IBM selectric. I also bought a skateboard. Yush and I have been occasionally going to the Millbrae skate park to practice. It is a really nice way to exercise during the summer. I have been enjoying it.</p><h3 id=new-jobs>New Jobs</h3><h4 id=6-skills-summer-campe>6 Skills Summer Campe</h4><p>This summer I am teaching a camp for the 6 skills chinese school. I love teaching writting and giving the students topics that they are interested in to practice reading. We did a storyboard class as well. I think its good for the students to focus on producing type activities. I think they get enough input from school so I wanted to give them a chance to output. We created storys. We played a pass the story game where each person writes down the next line of a story, but you could only see the previous line. Everyday we took turn adding lines and by Friday we had an incomplete nonsensical story that made us all laugh. I noticed teaching the 7 year old kid that he is up for basically anything. He does well when we frequently switch activties. He also enjoyed creating stories.</p><h4 id=aops>AOPS</h4><p>Art of problem solving is opening a new branch in San Mateo this coming September and I applied for the job and actually got it! This is fantastic news because now I can actually get paid to study math. It has been a long time goal of mine (since greaduating college) to go back and review mathematics from the beggining to fill in gaps in my education that I noticed when I took Calculus. Besides that, I have always loved AOPS approach to mathematics and I am excited to get the chance to work there. I need to spend the next few weeks preparing by reviewing the mathematics that I will be teaching.</p><h3 id=san-diego>San Diego</h3><p>Whirlwind trip to San Diego for my cousin&rsquo;s high school graduation. I had not seen them since they were in middle school. Crazy. Luckily no more trips on the horizon. Truth be told I don&rsquo;t travel well.</p><h3 id=media>Media</h3><p>I watched both of these using chinese dubs. It felt great even I probably only understood about 1/2</p><ul><li>Kagakagur girl (trash)</li><li>Squid Games (mega trash)</li><li>Listened to a History of Western Philosophy before bed. Last night hearing about David Hume and some of his theories kept me up late (such as his thoughts about expectation and conditionality).</li><li>attack on titan volumes 1-5. decided its not for me. the dialogue does not connect with me and I don&rsquo;t feel invested in the characters. I think maybe manga does&rsquo;nt let me get inside the characters head in the way some novels do. Maybe I just don&rsquo;t like comics?</li><li>Decided to revisit the Gateway to Great books but use topics to guide my reading.</li></ul><h3 id=other-stuff>Other stuff</h3><ul><li>WWDC happened and was thankfully uneventful</li><li>Went on a walk with some of Sean&rsquo;s taiwan friends. I told them my name was pao pao xiao bao bei (from doremi) and this joke killed.</li><li>started learning chopin&rsquo;s etude in e major.</li></ul><h2 id=september>September</h2><ul><li>Natalie Poon died. This really shook me and opened up grief regarding my mom. She was only 33 years old. It&rsquo;s crazy because only a week earlier, she had accidentally called me. She was trying to find parking at 9pm in Mammoth. She asked if parking in a 2 hour zone would be okay. I advised that it would be and that I was highly skeptical than anyone in Mammoth was checking 2 hour parking at 9pm. Who would have thought this conversation would be the last time I would ever talk with her. Grief is said to happen in stages and I have find myself bouncing around through them. I am trying to use her death as reminder that I should cherish each moment.</li><li>The first Memoria. I met with Woz, the founder of supermemo. I asked him to give an example of how to use superememo to learn about soap. He said &lsquo;incidentally, I was just learning about soap yesterday&rsquo;.</li><li>I have started rectiting a personal affirmation each morning.</li><li>I created an incremental group reading chat bot on discord.</li><li>I am trying to focus on getting my mind, heart, and body in alignment. I have developed my morning routine and it involves going to the gym, a protein shake, then meditation.</li><li>I&rsquo;m focusing on multiple shorter focused meditations throughout the day.</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><em>List of Buddhist temples in Kyoto Prefecture</em>,
