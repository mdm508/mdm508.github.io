# Chapter 1 

## How do I run my code?
Since we are doing pure swift right now I reccomend creating a **command line app** instead of an iOS app. 

1) Open **Xcode** â†’ **File** â†’ **New** â†’ **Projectâ€¦**  
2) Choose **macOS** â†’ **Command Line Tool** â†’ **Next**.  
3) Set **Product Name**: `HelloWorldCLI` Â· **Language**: **Swift** â†’ **Next** â†’ **Create**.  
4) Xcode creates **`main.swift`** with `print("Hello, World!")` already inside.  
5) Press **âŒ˜R** (Run). You'll see **Hello, World!** in Xcode's console at the bottom.

### What's Xcode doing for you?
It's okay to skip or come back to this section. Read this if you want to know a bit more about the magic behind running
your code. 

When you press **âŒ˜R**, Xcode performs several steps automatically:

1. **Compilation**: The Swift compiler (`swiftc`) reads your `.swift` files and translates them into machine code that your computer's processor can understand.

   **Machine code** is the lowest-level programming languageâ€”just numbers (represented as 1s and 0s) that directly tell the processor what to do. For example, your Swift code `let x = 5` might become something like this in machine code:
   ```
   48 c7 c0 05 00 00 00    mov    $0x5,%rax
   48 89 45 f8             mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)
   ```
   Those cryptic numbers and letters are instructions like "move the value 5 into a storage location." Fortunately, you never have to write or read machine codeâ€”that's what Swift is for!

2. **Linking**: The compiler combines your code with Swift's standard library (which provides things like `print()`, `String`, `Int`, etc.) to create a complete executable program.

   Think of it this way: When you write `print("Hello")`, you're calling a function that you didn't write yourselfâ€”it's part of Swift's standard library. Your compiled code might say "call the print function," but it doesn't contain the actual code that makes printing work. The linker finds that `print()` function in Swift's pre-compiled library and connects (or "links") it to your program, so when your program runs, it knows where to find `print()`.

3. **Execution**: Xcode runs the resulting executable and captures its output to display in the console.

 You write instructions in Swift (human-readable), the compiler translates them into machine language (computer-readable), and then your computer follows those instructions. It's similar to how you might write a recipe in English, translate it to another language, and then someone who speaks that language can follow it.


### Want to try compiling Swift yourself?
You don't need Xcode! Here's how to compile and run Swift code manually:

1. **Create a text file**: Open **TextEdit** â†’ **Format** â†’ **Make Plain Text** (â‡§âŒ˜T)
2. **Write some Swift code**:
   ```swift
   print("Hello from the command line!")
   let name = "Swift"
   print("I'm learning \(name)")
   ```
3. **Save it**: Save as `hello.swift` on your **Desktop** (make sure it ends with `.swift`)
4. **Open Terminal**: Press **âŒ˜Space**, type "Terminal", press **Enter**
5. **Navigate to Desktop**: Type `cd Desktop` and press **Enter**
6. **Compile and run**: Type `swift hello.swift` and press **Enter**

You should see your output! The `swift` command both compiles and runs your code in one step. Pretty cool that you can write Swift code in any text editor and run it from the command line!

**Why am I showing you this?** I want you to know that Swift isn't just for creating iPhone and Mac apps! You can use Swift for many other things:

- **Command-line tools** (like file organizers, text processors, or calculators)
- **Web servers** (using frameworks like Vapor to build websites)
- **Data analysis scripts** (processing CSV files, analyzing data)
- **Automation scripts** (automating repetitive tasks on your computer)
- **System administration** (managing files, networks, or servers)
- **Cross-platform apps** (desktop apps that run on Windows, Linux, and Mac)

Swift is a general-purpose programming language, not just an "app language"!

# 7 Key Concepts

## 1. Statements & Newlines
Swift is written as a series of **statements**. A newline usually ends a statement; semicolons are optional and mainly for multiple statements on one line. Prefer one idea per line for clarity.

```swift
let teaCups = 2
print("Brewing \(teaCups) cups of oolong")

let a = 1; let b = 2; print(a + b) // valid, but harder to read
```

---

## 2. Operators Are Functions; Method Chains Read Top-to-Bottom

Operators like `+` are real functions, so `(+)(3, 4)` equals `3 + 4`. Long transformations read well when you break **before** the dot.

```swift
let sum = (+)(3, 4) // same as 3 + 4

let title = "fugue"
    .uppercased()
    .replacingOccurrences(of: "F", with: "ðŸŽ¼F")
print(title) // ðŸŽ¼FUGUE
```

---

## 3. Three Custom Type Shapes: `struct`, `class`, `enum`

Use a `struct` for simple value data, a `class` when you need shared identity (reference semantics), and an `enum` for clear, finite choices.

```swift
struct Tea { var name: String; var tempC: Int }          // copies on assign
final class MusicPlayer { var isPlaying = false }        // shared reference
enum PokemonType { case fire, water, grass }             // finite cases
```

---

## 4. `let` vs `var` and First Functions

`let` makes a constant; `var` makes a variable. Functions can use external/internal parameter names so calls read like English.

```swift
let composer = "Bach"
var movement = 1

func move(from start: Int, to end: Int) -> String {
    "Moved from \(start) to \(end)"
}
print(move(from: 1, to: 3))
```

---

## 5. Top-Level Code, Scope, and Lifetime

You can write simple top-level code in playgrounds and scripts. **Scope** = where a name is visible. **Lifetime** = how long it exists.

```swift
func favoriteBook() {
    let title = "Pride and Prejudice" // scope: only inside function
    print(title)
}
// print(title) // error: not visible here
```

---

## 6. Namespaces, Modules, Instances, and `self`

Types are **namespaces** for their members. Modules (what you `import`) are larger namespaces. Access members on an **instance** with `.`, and use `self` when needed (e.g., to disambiguate).

```swift
struct Sonata {
    var key = "C minor"
    func label() -> String { "Sonata in \(key)" }
}

let pathetique = Sonata()
print(pathetique.label()) // "Sonata in C minor"
```

---

## 7. Access Control: `private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `public`, `open`

Hide details to keep APIs clean. Default is `internal`. Use `private` for helpers inside a type; `public`/`open` only for APIs meant for other modules.

```swift
public struct Library {
    public private(set) var books: [String] = []
    func add(_ title: String) { books.append(title) } // internal by default
}
```

# Key Terms

<div class="swiftnote-table">

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Statement** | A single instruction in Swift code, usually ending with a newline |
| **Operator** | A symbol like `+`, `-`, `*` that performs operations; operators are actually functions |
| **Struct** | A custom type that creates value semantics (copies when assigned) |
| **Class** | A custom type that creates reference semantics (shared identity) |
| **Enum** | A custom type that represents a finite set of cases |
| **Constant** | A value declared with `let` that cannot be changed |
| **Variable** | A value declared with `var` that can be modified |
| **Scope** | The area of code where a name is visible and can be used |
| **Lifetime** | How long a value exists in memory |
| **Namespace** | A container that groups related names together |
| **Module** | A collection of Swift code that can be imported |
| **Instance** | A specific occurrence of a type with its own state |
| **Method** | A function that belongs to a type |
| **Parameter** | Input to a function; can have external and internal names |
| **Access Control** | Keywords that control visibility of code (`private`, `public`, etc.) |
| **Internal** | Default access level; visible within the same module |
| **Public** | Access level that makes code visible to other modules |
| **Private** | Access level that hides code within the same type |

# Drills 

1. Put two statements on one line with semicolons, then split them onto separate lines.

2. Call an operator as a function: `(+)(10, 20)`; compare with `10 + 20`.

3. Define a `struct` `Tea { var name: String; var tempC: Int }`; make two teas and print them.

4. Write `func label(song: String, composer: String) -> String` that returns `"composer â€” song"`. Call it.

5. Inside a function, declare `let pages = 300`; try using it outside the function (show the compiler error in a comment).

6. Create `enum PokemonType { case fire, water, grass }` and a `switch` that returns a one-sentence description for each.

7. Make a `public struct Library` with `public private(set) var books = [String]()` and an `add(_:)` method; show that callers can read `books` but not modify it directly.

# Programming Exercises 

## 1. Tea Temperature Tracker 

Practice `struct`, `let`/`var`, and methods.

```swift
struct Tea {
    var name: String
    var tempC: Int

    func cool(by degrees: Int) -> Tea {
        return Tea(name: name, tempC: max(0, tempC - degrees))
    }

    func label() -> String { "\(name) â€” \(tempC)Â°C" }
}

// TODO:
// 1) Make two teas ("Oolong" at 90, "Matcha" at 75).
// 2) Cool one by 10 degrees; print both labels.
// 3) Notice how `cool(by:)` returns a new Tea instead of modifying the original.
```

---

## 2. PokÃ©mon Type Announcer (from scratch)

Use an `enum` + exhaustive `switch`.

**Requirements**

* Define `enum PokemonType { case fire, water, grass }`
* Write `func announce(_ t: PokemonType) -> String`
* Return: `"ðŸ”¥ Fire beats Grass"`, `"ðŸ’§ Water beats Fire"`, `"ðŸŒ¿ Grass beats Water"`

**Test**

```swift
print(announce(.fire))
print(announce(.water))
print(announce(.grass))
```

---

## 3. Composer Card 

Practice external/internal parameter names and string interpolation.

```swift
// Implement so the call reads like English.
func card(for work: String, by composer: String) -> String {
    // TODO: return "composer â€” work"
    return ""
}

// Expected: "Bach â€” Goldberg Variations"
print(card(for: "Goldberg Variations", by: "Bach"))
```

1. Add one more call with a favorite piece.
2. Go listen to some [Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYouXtuk0T8&start_radio=1)

---

## 4. Little Library (from scratch)

Access control + type as namespace.

* Create `public struct Library` with `public private(set) var books: [String] = []`
* Add `func add(_ title: String)`
* Add `private func normalize(_ title: String) -> String` that trims spaces
* Show that `normalize` isn't visible outside `Library`
* Demonstrate that external code can read `books` but must call `add(_:)` to modify it

---

## 5. Operator-as-Function Mini-Lab (starter provided)

See how operators are ordinary functions.

```swift
let a = 7, b = 5
let sum1 = a + b
let sum2 = (+)(a, b)
print(sum1 == sum2) // expect true

// TODO:
// 1) Compare `a * b` with `(*)(a, b)`.
// 2) In a comment, explain how knowing this helps you read fluent chains and unfamiliar code.
```
