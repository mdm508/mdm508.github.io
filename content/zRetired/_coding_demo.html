### Lesson Preview
In the first half of the lesson, we will use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and in the second, [WeScheme](https://www.wescheme.org/).

- We will use the [Scratch Starter](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898666614) to make a simple snowflake-catching game.
- Then we will make cool shapes with the [WeScheme Starter](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/hoc-wescheme-intro/index.shtml#).

Get ready to have some fun. See you at the demo.
