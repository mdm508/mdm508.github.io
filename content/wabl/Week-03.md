## Intentions
- Complete a prototype card at each resolution.

## Monday - Thursday
Last week got away from me. I think I went a little overboard
and exhausted my supply of willpower. I know it's already
Friday but I want to try and just work on it a little bit 
each day for the rest of the week.

## Thursday
- Make a card template.
- Create a picture of a tree.
