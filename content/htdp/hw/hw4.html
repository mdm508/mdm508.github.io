assignment, start with either your <a href="hw2.html">HW 2</a> code or start
with the <a href="https://rains.cs.utah.edu:7979/servlets/status.ss">HW 2
solution</a>.  You won&rsquo;t have to modify any of your old program; just add
new functions to the end. You should use templates to implement functions,
but the templates need not be included in the work that you handin this time.</p><p>The main data structure for this assignment is a <tt>block</tt>, which
has a position and color.  The position refers to the location of the
block&rsquo;s top-left corner in the scene, and each block is 30 pixels wide
and 30 pixels high. The specific <tt>block</tt> data definition is up to
you.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like a peek at the result of this homework, executables
are available for <a href="mad.zip">Windows</a> and <a href="mad.dmg">Mac OS
X</a>. The executables were created from the instructor&rsquo;s solution using
&ldquo;Create Executable&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Racket&rdquo; menu.</p><h3>Part 1 &ndash; Generate Blocks</h3><p>Implement the function <tt>gen-blocks</tt>, which takes three
arguments: a natural number <i>n</i>, a number <i>x</i>, a number <i>y</i>, and
a string <i>col</i>. The <tt>gen-blocks</tt> function should produce a list
of <i>n</i> blocks with color <i>col</i>, where the last block (for
<i>n</i>&#8804;1) is positioned <i>x</i> pixels from the left edge of the scene
and <i>y</i> pixels down, the next-to-last one (for <i>n</i>&#8805;2) is also <i>x</i> pixels
from the left edge but <i>y</i>+30 pixels down, and so on&mdash;forming a
solid vertical wall of <i>n</i> blocks. Alternatively, your <tt>gen-blocks</tt> can produce
the list in the reverse order; either order is ok.</p><h3>Part 2 &ndash; Removing Blocks</h3><p>Implement the function <tt>remove-blocks</tt>, which takes a list of
<tt>block</tt>s and a <tt>posn</tt>. The result should be a list of
<tt>block</tt>s that <i>do not</i> touch the given <tt>posn</tt>.</p><p>A <tt>block</tt> touches a <tt>posn</tt> if the <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s left edge is
no greater than the <tt>posn</tt>&rsquo;s x-coordinate, the <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s right edge
is no less than the <tt>posn</tt>&rsquo;s x-coordinate, the <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s top edge is
no greater than the <tt>posn</tt>&rsquo;s y-coordinate, and the <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s bottom edge
is no less than the <tt>posn</tt>&rsquo;s y-coordinate.</p><p>For example, <tt>(remove-blocks (gen-blocks 2 10
10 "blue") (make-posn 20 20))</tt> should produce the same result as
<tt>(gen-blocks 1 10 40 "blue")</tt>.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget that when you&rsquo;re writing a function that consumes a
list of <tt>block</tt>s, you almost certainly want a function that handles
each individual <tt>block</tt>. The function that takes a <tt>block</tt> will have its own contract,
purpose, template (whether you keep it or not), and tests.</p><h3>Part 3 &ndash; Adding Blocks to a Scene</h3><p>Implement <tt>add-blocks-to-scene</tt>, which takes a list of
<tt>block</tt>s and a <tt>scene</tt> and returns a new <tt>scene</tt> with the
blocks added. Each block should be added to the scene at its position
and using the block&rsquo;s color.</p><h3>Part 4 &ndash; The Game</h3><p>A <tt>game</tt> combines a <tt>launch</tt> (from <a href="hw2.html">HW 2</a>) with a
list of <tt>block</tt>s:</p><pre>  ;; A game is
  ;;   (make-game launch list-of-block)
  (define-struct game (launch blocks))</pre><p>Implement</p><ul><li><tt>game-scene</tt>, which takes a <tt>game</tt> and produces a <tt>scene</tt>
that includes both the duck and the blocks;</li>

<li><tt>mouse-game</tt>, which takes a <tt>game</tt>, a number, a number,
and a mouse-event string and returns a new <tt>game</tt>, where
the mouse event can affect the launch in the same way as for <tt>mouse-scene</tt>;
and</li>

<li><tt>step-game</tt>, which takes a <tt>game</tt> and returns a <tt>game</tt> that, for now,
simply steps the <tt>launch</tt> while keeping the list of <tt>block</tt>s the same.</li></ul><p>With those pieces, you can try running you game so far:</p><pre>  (big-bang
   (make-game false (gen-blocks 10 600 300 "blue"))
   [to-draw game-scene]
   [on-tick step-game]
   [on-mouse mouse-game])</pre><p>Of course, the duck doesn&rsquo;t yet smash the blocks.</p><h3>Part 5 &ndash; Smash Blocks</h3><p>Change <tt>step-game</tt> so that after the <tt>game</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>launch</tt> is
stepped, if the <tt>launch</tt> is a flying <tt>duck</tt>, then any blocks
that are touched by the duck&rsquo;s center are removed from the <tt>game</tt>
returned by <tt>step-game</tt>.</p><p>You will probably want to implement a helper function
<tt>combine-game</tt>, which takes a (new) <tt>launch</tt> and a list of
<tt>block</tt>s and returns the <tt>launch</tt> combined with a suitably
filtered list of <tt>block</tt>s. The <tt>combine-game</tt> helper, in turn,
should use other functions that you&rsquo;ve written for this
assignment.</p><h3>Part 6 &ndash; Watch out for Falling Blocks</h3><p>After a flying duck smashes blocks, blocks that are not supported
by other blocks should fall.</p><p>Implement <tt>drop-blocks</tt>, which takes a list of <tt>block</tt>s and
moves each <tt>block</tt> in the list down by 1 (i.e., increases its
y-position by 1) if no <tt>block</tt> with a greater y position anywhere in
the list touches the <tt>block</tt> and if the <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s bottom edge is not
already touching the ground (which is at 600 pixels).</p><p>You&rsquo;ll probably want several helper functions:</p><ul>
 <li>The <tt>drop-blocks</tt> function might simply call
<tt>drop-blocks*</tt>, which takes a list of <tt>blocks</tt> to potentially drop
and an unchanging list of all <tt>block</tt>s. The two lists start the
same, but the second list is along for the ride in
<tt>drop-blocks*</tt> (i.e., recursive calls keep the second list the
same).</li>

 <li>To implement <tt>drop-blocks*</tt>, you&rsquo;ll probably need
<tt>drop-one-block</tt>, with takes a single <tt>block</tt> and a list of
<tt>block</tt>s and drops the single <tt>block</tt> if it is not touching any
lower <tt>block</tt> (i.e., greater y position) in the list of <tt>block</tt>s
and not touching the ground.</li>

<li>To implement <tt>drop-one-block</tt>, you&rsquo;ll probably want a
<tt>any-below?</tt>  function that takes the same arguments as
<tt>drop-one-block</tt>, but simply reports whether any <tt>block</tt> in the
list of <tt>block</tt>s is below and touching the single <tt>block</tt>.</li>

<li>To implement <tt>any-below?</tt>, you&rsquo;ll probably need a
<tt>block-below?</tt> function that takes two <tt>block</tt>s and determines
whether the first <tt>block</tt> has a greater y position than the second
<tt>block</tt>, whether any of the first <tt>block</tt>&rsquo;s four corners touch the
second <tt>block</tt>, and whether and the second <tt>block</tt> is not already touching
the ground.</li>
</ul><h3>Part 7 &ndash; Mildy Annoyed Ducks!</h3><p>Adjust <tt>step-game</tt> so that after the <tt>launch</tt> is stepped and before
blocks are smashed, the blocks drop as implemented by <tt>drop-blocks</tt>.</p><p>Use the <tt>big-bang</tt> form above to play your game.</p><hr /><table width="100%"><tr><td align="right">Last update: Friday, August 26th, 2022<address>matthedm@uci.edu</address></td></tr></table></body></html>
