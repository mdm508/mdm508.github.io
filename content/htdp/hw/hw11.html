the phone company and one window for a customer who wants to find phone
numbers (i.e., starting the program creates two windows):</p><ul>
<li><p>The phone-company window should have five elements:
<ol><li>A place to type a name.</li>
<li>A place to type a phone number.</li>
<li>An &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button that installs the name and number into a phone book.</li>
<li>A place to type an area code.</li>
<li>An &ldquo;Add Area Code&rdquo; button that changes all 7-digit phone numbers
in the phone book to be 10-digit numbers using the specific area code.</li></ol></p></li>

<li><p>The customer window should have three elements:
<ol><li>A place to type a name.</li>
<li>A &ldquo;Lookup&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>A place for the phone number (if known) to appear for the given
name after the &ldquo;Lookup&rdquo; button is pushed.</li></ol></p></li>
</ul><p>The phone-company and customer windows are separate views and controls for the same
model, where the shared model implements a phone book. That is, if you add
a name with the phone-company window and then switch to the customer window,
you should be able to lookup the name that was just registered by the phone-company window.</p><p>The phone book should start out empty when you start the program.</p><hr /><table width="100%"><tr><td align="right">Last update: Friday, August 26th, 2022<address>matthedm@uci.edu</address></td></tr></table></body></html>
