following required elements:</p><ul>
<li>It should be a graphical game implemented with Racket and the
<tt>2htdp/universe</tt> library or in Java with swing GUI classes.
(Racket is probably easier for this task.)</li>

<li>All tiles should be covered intially.</li>

<li>Handle clicks on a tile to reveal either a blank space
(no adjacent bombs), a number (between 1 and 8 adjacent bombs),
or a bomb.</li>

<li>The initial board should be configurable and it should describe
where the bombs are located.  Numbers showing adjacent-bomb counts
should be computed from that initial board.</li>
</ul><p>You can choose a fixed size for the board, or you can make the
size configurable.  For initial boards, you can try to generate them
randomly or just use a fixed board (as long as the rest of the
implementation doesn&rsquo;t depend on that specific fixed board).</p><p>For extra credit, include an option in the game to indicate which
of the currently covered tiles could be safely uncovered using at least
single-square analysis (as described on the Wikipedia page) and
information about the uncovered tiles.</p><hr /><table width="100%"><tr><td align="right">Last update: Friday, August 26th, 2022<address>matthedm@uci.edu</address></td></tr></table></body></html>
