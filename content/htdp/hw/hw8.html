work using DrRacket. The handin server will not try to run any tests.
The handin server will call your submitted file <tt>hw.java</tt>; unfortuately,
however, the  file will be saved in DrRacket&rsquo;s non-text format.</p><p>Use the subset of Java that we have covered in class. In particular,
use the <tt>=</tt> assignment operator only in constructors.</p><h3>Part 1 &ndash; Lions</h3><p>The relevant properties of a lion are, in order</p><ol><li>The number of teeth it has</li>
<li>The name of the person it most recently ate (maybe <tt>"no one"</tt>)</li></ol><p>Here is an initial class definition:</p><pre>  class Lion {
    int teeth;
    String ate;
    Lion(int teeth, String ate) {
       this.teeth = teeth;
       this.ate = ate;
    }
  }</pre><p>Implement the <tt>Lion</tt> method <tt>moreScary</tt>, which
produces a lion with two additional teeth (but the same stomach contents).</p><h3>Part 2 &ndash; and Tigers</h3><p>Design a representation for tigers, where the relevant properties of a tiger are</p><ol><li>The number of stripes it has (an integer)</li>
<li>The length of its claws in centimeters (a <tt>double</tt>)</li>
<li>The name of the person it most recently ate (maybe <tt>"no one"</tt>)</li></ol><p>Use <tt>Tiger</tt> as the name of your class, and put the constructor arguments in the above order.</p><p>Implement the <tt>Tiger</tt> method <tt>moreScary</tt>, which
produces a tiger (with the same fur pattern and stomach contents)
whose claws are one centimeter longer.</p><h3>Part 3 &ndash; and Bears</h3><p>Design a representation for bears, where the relevant properties of a bear are</p><ol><li>Its fur color, as a string</li>
 <li>The name of the person it most recently ate (maybe <tt>"no one"</tt>)</li></ol><p>Use <tt>Bear</tt> as the name of your class, and put the constructor arguments in the above order.</p><p>Implement the <tt>Bear</tt> method <tt>moreScary</tt>, which
produces a bear (with the same fur color)
that hasn&rsquo;t eaten recently.</p><h3>Part 4 &ndash; Oh My!</h3><p>Define the interface <tt>IOzAnimal</tt> and adjust your earlier
class declarations so that an Oz animal is a lion, tiger, or bear.</p><p>Add the <tt>IOzAnimal</tt> method <tt>moreScary</tt>, which produces a scarier animal (as above).
Adjust the return types of previoulsy implemented methods if necessary.</p><h3>Part 5 &ndash; Erp</h3><p>Define the <tt>IOzAnimal</tt> method <tt>feed</tt> that takes a string
for a person&rsquo;s name. The result should be an <tt>IOzAnimal</tt>
that just ate the person whose name is given.</p><h3>Part 6 &ndash; Rescue</h3><p>Define the <tt>IOzAnimal</tt> method <tt>rescue</tt> that takes no
arguments and returns an <tt>IOzAnimal</tt> that hasn&rsquo;t recently eaten anyone.</p><h3>Part 7 &ndash; Oz Scenes</h3><p>An Oz scene consists of one person and one <tt>IOzAnimal</tt>.
It is represented as an <tt>OzScene</tt>:</p><pre>  class OzScene {
    String person;
    IOzAnimal animal;
    OzScene(String person, OzAnimal animal) {
      this.person = person;
      this.animal = animal;
    }</pre><p>Implement the <tt>OzScene</tt> method <tt>moreScary</tt>, which takes no
arguments and produces one with a scarier animal and the same person.</p><h3>Part 8 &ndash; A Wizard of Oz</h3><p>An Oz scene moves the next scene as follows:</p><ul><li>If a person is in the scene, then the animal
eats the person (and no one is left), unless the person is named <tt>"wizard"</tt>.</li>
<li>If the person is named <tt>"wizard"</tt>, and
if the animal&rsquo;s stomach is not empty, then the previously eaten person is rescued to
and takes the wizard&rsquo;s place (and the wizard leaves).</li>
<li>If no one is present, the animal simply gets scarier.</li>
<li>Otherwise (only a wizard and an animal with an empty stomach), nothing happens.</li></ul><p>Implement the <tt>OzScene</tt> method <tt>next</tt>, which takes no arguments returns
the next <tt>OzScene</tt> according to the rules above.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to break up the problem into smaller pieces. For example, you might
find an <tt>animalAte</tt> method of <tt>OzAnimal</tt>
useful (that takes no arguments returns a string for
the person that the animal recently ate).</p><hr /><table width="100%"><tr><td align="right">Last update: Friday, August 26th, 2022<address>matthedm@uci.edu</address></td></tr></table></body></html>
