## March

Week 13 Range: March 24, 2025 – March 30, 2025

### March 24 - March 30

#### Monday
- I like keeping track of the year using the current week number.
- Lately I have been trying to learn the abacus. My goal this week is to improve my speed by continually adding the number 13.
- My 30th is coming up and it would feel great to publish that update before saturday. 
- I have woke up for 4am for 5 days in a row. I have been sleeping around 6 hours lately. It is hard to get up but I am always happy I got up later. 
- It seems like my ideal morning routine is 
    - make your bed
    - meditate
    - gym
    - program iOS

I am struggling to respect my new early bed time. Here I am at 9:46, 46 minutes late. I bought a 12 dollar doraemon alarm clock. You have to manually
set it each night. 

#### Friday 
- My Grandma stopped by the house and gave me two early birthday presents. A rasberry birthday cake and a pair of cross pens. She remembered that I was upset about loosing the pen my mom gave me! I was not expecting this gift at all but it made me so happy. I will not loose these pens (actually one of them is a mechanical pencil, the other a ball point pen). I won't loose them because I am never going to take them out of the house. They will remain in the same place at all times. 

#### Saturday
Today I turned 30. I decided to go bowling with my dad, sister, her fiance, and Yush! I didn't like putting my fingers into the holes so I developed a new two handed technique. It is not very accurate but I am able to generate a lot of speed.

### March 31 - April 6

#### Monday
- Today I spent over 10 hours helping Yush plan a trip to Kyoto. 
- I created a custom google map to help reccomend interesting places based on what district she's in. 
- Turns out Kyoto has over 1600 temples![^1]

#### Tuesday 
I’ve been faithfully following my 4am, albeit insane, wake-up routine—but today, I needed a nap. The nap went on too long I actually felt more tired afterward.

#### Wednesday
- My dreams were strange. Yush was in the garage in my office but I could not see her. She was a disembodied voice. It felt like the window was talking to me. She was reading math formulas to me in Chinese on a school broadcast system. At some other point I recall being chased by the police. They never caught me. 
- I went to the gym in the morning after meditation. I got there at 6am and still couldn't get a prime parking spot. 
- I'm still procrastinating on iOS but I realized why `PersistenceController` was not being seen by my main app; I simply forgot to mark each of the files inside the `Persistence` framework as members of the `Persistence` target. I had assumed placing the files inside the framework`s folder was enough. Turns out you need to explicitally mark the source file as a member of the target.

#### Thursday 
- I read for a few hours and realized that I was craving quality input. Reading was more enjoyable then watching TV or dumb videos online.
- My office is pretty cold given the lack of insulation so I hung up some blankets to create a fort, in hopes to trap the warm air. I think its a failure so far.
- Yush is in Taiwan so I have the house to myself for a month. I'd love to use this time to improve my meditation practice. It is really quiet if I don't turn on the radio. I hope to give myself some time to enjoy the silence.

#### Friday 
- I have still procrastinated on my morning iOS routine. After going to the gym at 530 I feel pretty tired. It might be prudent to go to the gym in the afternoon and protect those precious morning hours for focused work. 
- After the gym I stopped by St.Dunstan's Church to practice meditation. I was suprised to find the entire church adorned in purple. People in the front pews of the church was chanting something. I think it might be lent right now. It was a nice space to practice meditation in. It was like 3:00pm and kids were just getting out of class. A few of them went into the church with their mom to pray. In the 9 years I went to that school I cannot recall a single instance of going to Church after school with my mom to pray. I don't think I'm really catholic anymore, I consider mysef Buddhist, but I decided to try praying and talking with Jesus nonetheless. I said "hey, what's up, it's been a while". I was reminded of logging into Wii fitness last year and the screen said "it has been 5,208 days since your last workout". I asked Jesus to help me focus, but then I felt bad because I realized that everytime I talked to him I was always asking for stuff. Even when I was a kid. So then I apolagized and told him 'actually its okay, I dont need anything, i'm just saying, whats up". I love the idea of a guardian angel and for better or for worse Jesus has been burned into my memory and is probably the most iconic figure I can think of. So, I guess, I mine as well make use of that. I'm trying to personify skillful versions of myself as a guardian angel and I think Jesus is an obvious canidate. 
- So in short, going to the Church when no one is there and there is no mass is quite relaxing. I love religous spaces and places of worship. It is also just weird to think that I sat in those same pews not too long ago.
- Then I went to McDonald's  bought an iced coffee for $0.99. Starbuck's is too expensive so I decided to read at McDonalds which is conveinently located accross from the church. 
- I'm realizing that keeping a dream log is basically the same as keeping a real life log. Now I perhaps better understand Zhuangzi's piece about the butterfly. 

#### Weekend
- I finished *Source Code*!

## April – May

I didn't write at all during April and May so I will just list some bullets of random things.

- Helped tutor for geometry. I had to really intensely review all my highschool geometry and was studying 4 hours or more each day. It felt like I was back in school and was kind of fun. I studied so much that I was dreaming about geometry.
- Yush was gone during April and returned in May. I had lots of alone time.
- I bought a camera and started taking photos. I later found another camera (only for pictures though) in my garage. I want to add more photos to this website and appreciate beauty in the world. I am also interested in learning about photo editing.
- Completed my Chinese class. We performed Cinderella. I wrote a modern adaption of the play where instead of staying in an abusive household, Cinderella leaves and gets a job at a coffee shop. Fast foward 3 years later and she is the manager and going steady with the prince. Here is the [Cinderella-script](/post/cinderella)

## June

### Big Purchases
I spent way too much money this month. I got carried away an bought two typewriters, one electric, one analog. I have been putting them to good use however. The electric one is for journaling and the other for taking notes. Someday I want to get an IBM selectric. I also bought a skateboard. Yush and I have been occasionally going to the Millbrae skate park to practice. It is a really nice way to exercise during the summer. I have been enjoying it. 

### New Jobs
#### 6 Skills Summer Campe
This summer I am teaching a camp for the 6 skills chinese school. I love teaching writting and giving the students topics that they are interested in to practice reading. We did a storyboard class as well. I think its good for the students to focus on producing type activities. I think they get enough input from school so I wanted to give them a chance to output. We created storys. We played a pass the story game where each person writes down the next line of a story, but you could only see the previous line. Everyday we took turn adding lines and by Friday we had an incomplete nonsensical story that made us all laugh. I noticed teaching the 7 year old kid that he is up for basically anything. He does well when we frequently switch activties. He also enjoyed creating stories.

#### AOPS
Art of problem solving is opening a new branch in San Mateo this coming September and I applied for the job and actually got it! This is fantastic news because now I can actually get paid to study math. It has been a long time goal of mine (since greaduating college) to go back and review mathematics from the beggining to fill in gaps in my education that I noticed when I took Calculus. Besides that, I have always loved AOPS approach to mathematics and I am excited to get the chance to work there. I need to spend the next few weeks preparing by reviewing the mathematics that I will be teaching. 

### San Diego
Whirlwind trip to San Diego for my cousin's high school graduation. I had not seen them since they were in middle school. Crazy. Luckily no more trips on the horizon. Truth be told I don't travel well.

### Media
I watched both of these using chinese dubs. It felt great even I probably only understood about 1/2
-  Kagakagur girl (trash)
-  Squid Games (mega trash)
- Listened to a History of Western Philosophy before bed. Last night hearing about David Hume and some of his theories kept me up late (such as his thoughts about expectation and conditionality). 
- attack on titan volumes 1-5. decided its not for me. the dialogue does not connect with me and I don't feel invested in the characters. I think maybe manga does'nt let me get inside the characters head in the way some novels do. Maybe I just don't like comics?
- Decided to revisit the Gateway to Great books but use topics to guide my reading.

### Other stuff
- WWDC happened and was thankfully uneventful
- Went on a walk with some of Sean's taiwan friends. I told them my name was pao pao xiao bao bei (from doremi) and this joke killed.
- started learning chopin's etude in e major.

## September
- Natalie Poon died. This really shook me and opened up grief regarding my mom. She was only 33 years old. It's crazy because only a week earlier, she had accidentally called me. She was trying to find parking at 9pm in Mammoth. She asked if parking in a 2 hour zone would be okay. I advised that it would be and that I was highly skeptical than anyone in Mammoth was checking 2 hour parking at 9pm. Who would have thought this conversation would be the last time I would ever talk with her. Grief is said to happen in stages and I have find myself bouncing around through them. I am trying to use her death as reminder that I should cherish each moment.
- The first Memoria. I met with Woz, the founder of supermemo. I asked him to give an example of how to use superememo to learn about soap. He said 'incidentally, I was just learning about soap yesterday'.
- I have started rectiting a personal affirmation each morning. 
- I created an incremental group reading chat bot on discord. 
- I am trying to focus on getting my mind, heart, and body in alignment. I have developed my morning routine and it involves going to the gym, a protein shake, then meditation.
- I'm focusing on multiple shorter focused meditations throughout the day.
