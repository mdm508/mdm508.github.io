## Big Purchases
I spent way too much money this month. I got carried away an bought two typewriters, one electric, one analog. I have been putting them to good use however. The electric one is for journaling and the other for taking notes. Someday I want to get an IBM selectric. I also bought a skateboard. Yush and I have been occasionally going to the Millbrae skate park to practice. It is a really nice way to exercise during the summer. I have been enjoying it. 

## New Jobs
### 6 Skills Summer Campe
This summer I am teaching a camp for the 6 skills chinese school. I love teaching writting and giving the students topics that they are interested in to practice reading. We did a storyboard class as well. I think its good for the students to focus on producing type activities. I think they get enough input from school so I wanted to give them a chance to output. We created storys. We played a pass the story game where each person writes down the next line of a story, but you could only see the previous line. Everyday we took turn adding lines and by Friday we had an incomplete nonsensical story that made us all laugh. I noticed teaching the 7 year old kid that he is up for basically anything. He does well when we frequently switch activties. He also enjoyed creating stories.

### AOPS
Art of problem solving is opening a new branch in San Mateo this coming September and I applied for the job and actually got it! This is fantastic news because now I can actually get paid to study math. It has been a long time goal of mine (since greaduating college) to go back and review mathematics from the beggining to fill in gaps in my education that I noticed when I took Calculus. Besides that, I have always loved AOPS approach to mathematics and I am excited to get the chance to work there. I need to spend the next few weeks preparing by reviewing the mathematics that I will be teaching. 

## San Diego
Whirlwind trip to San Diego for my cousin's high school graduation. I had not seen them since they were in middle school. Crazy. Luckily no more trips on the horizon. Truth be told I don't travel well.

## Media
I watched both of these using chinese dubs. It felt great even I probably only understood about 1/2
-  Kagakagur girl (trash)
-  Squid Games (mega trash)
- Listened to a History of Western Philosophy before bed. Last night hearing about David Hume and some of his theories kept me up late (such as his thoughts about expectation and conditionality). 
- attack on titan volumes 1-5. decided its not for me. the dialogue does not connect with me and I don't feel invested in the characters. I think maybe manga does'nt let me get inside the characters head in the way some novels do. Maybe I just don't like comics?
- Decided to revisit the Gateway to Great books but use topics to guide my reading.

## Other stuff
- WWDC happened and was thankfully uneventful
- Went on a walk with some of Sean's taiwan friends. I told them my name was pao pao xiao bao bei (from doremi) and this joke killed.
- started learning chopin's etude in e major.
