Week 13 Range: March 24, 2025 – March 30, 2025

## March 24 - March 30

### Monday
- I like keeping track of the year using the current week number.
- Lately I have been trying to learn the abacus. My goal this week is to improve my speed by continually adding the number 13.
- My 30th is coming up and it would feel great to publish that update before saturday. 
- I have woke up for 4am for 5 days in a row. I have been sleeping around 6 hours lately. It is hard to get up but I am always happy I got up later. 
- It seems like my ideal morning routine is 
    - make your bed
    - meditate
    - gym
    - program iOS

I am struggling to respect my new early bed time. Here I am at 9:46, 46 minutes late. I bought a 12 dollar doraemon alarm clock. You have to manually
set it each night. 

### Friday 
- My Grandma stopped by the house and gave me two early birthday presents. A rasberry birthday cake and a pair of cross pens. She remembered that I was upset about loosing the pen my mom gave me! I was not expecting this gift at all but it made me so happy. I will not loose these pens (actually one of them is a mechanical pencil, the other a ball point pen). I won't loose them because I am never going to take them out of the house. They will remain in the same place at all times. 

### Saturday
Today I turned 30. I decided to go bowling with my dad, sister, her fiance, and Yush! I didn't like putting my fingers into the holes so I developed a new two handed technique. It is not very accurate but I am able to generate a lot of speed.

## March 31 - April 6

### Monday
- Today I spent over 10 hours helping Yush plan a trip to Kyoto. 
- I created a custom google map to help reccomend interesting places based on what district she's in. 
- Turns out Kyoto has over 1600 temples![^1]

### Tuesday 
I’ve been faithfully following my 4am, albeit insane, wake-up routine—but today, I needed a nap. The nap went on too long I actually felt more tired afterward.

### Wednesday
- My dreams were strange. Yush was in the garage in my office but I could not see her. She was a disembodied voice. It felt like the window was talking to me. She was reading math formulas to me in Chinese on a school broadcast system. At some other point I recall being chased by the police. They never caught me. 
- I went to the gym in the morning after meditation. I got there at 6am and still couldn't get a prime parking spot. 
- I'm still procrastinating on iOS but I realized why `PersistenceController` was not being seen by my main app; I simply forgot to mark each of the files inside the `Persistence` framework as members of the `Persistence` target. I had assumed placing the files inside the framework`s folder was enough. Turns out you need to explicitally mark the source file as a member of the target.

### Thursday 
- I read for a few hours and realized that I was craving quality input. Reading was more enjoyable then watching TV or dumb videos online.
- My office is pretty cold given the lack of insulation so I hung up some blankets to create a fort, in hopes to trap the warm air. I think its a failure so far.
- Yush is in Taiwan so I have the house to myself for a month. I'd love to use this time to improve my meditation practice. It is really quiet if I don't turn on the radio. I hope to give myself some time to enjoy the silence.

### Friday 
- I have still procrastinated on my morning iOS routine. After going to the gym at 530 I feel pretty tired. It might be prudent to go to the gym in the afternoon and protect those precious morning hours for focused work. 
- After the gym I stopped by St.Dunstan's Church to practice meditation. I was suprised to find the entire church adorned in purple. People in the front pews of the church was chanting something. I think it might be lent right now. It was a nice space to practice meditation in. It was like 3:00pm and kids were just getting out of class. A few of them went into the church with their mom to pray. In the 9 years I went to that school I cannot recall a single instance of going to Church after school with my mom to pray. I don't think I'm really catholic anymore, I consider mysef Buddhist, but I decided to try praying and talking with Jesus nonetheless. I said "hey, what's up, it's been a while". I was reminded of logging into Wii fitness last year and the screen said "it has been 5,208 days since your last workout". I asked Jesus to help me focus, but then I felt bad because I realized that everytime I talked to him I was always asking for stuff. Even when I was a kid. So then I apolagized and told him 'actually its okay, I dont need anything, i'm just saying, whats up". I love the idea of a guardian angel and for better or for worse Jesus has been burned into my memory and is probably the most iconic figure I can think of. So, I guess, I mine as well make use of that. I'm trying to personify skillful versions of myself as a guardian angel and I think Jesus is an obvious canidate. 
- So in short, going to the Church when no one is there and there is no mass is quite relaxing. I love religous spaces and places of worship. It is also just weird to think that I sat in those same pews not too long ago.
- Then I went to McDonald's  bought an iced coffee for $0.99. Starbuck's is too expensive so I decided to read at McDonalds which is conveinently located accross from the church. 
- I'm realizing that keeping a dream log is basically the same as keeping a real life log. Now I perhaps better understand Zhuangzi's piece about the butterfly. 

### Weekend
- I finished *Source Code*!
