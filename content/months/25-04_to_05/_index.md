I didn't write at all during April and May so I will just list some bullets of random things.

- Helped tutor for geometry. I had to really intensely review all my highschool geometry and was studying 4 hours or more each day. It felt like I was back in school and was kind of fun. I studied so much that I was dreaming about geometry.
- Yush was gone during April and returned in May. I had lots of alone time.
- I bought a camera and started taking photos. I later found another camera (only for pictures though) in my garage. I want to add more photos to this website and appreciate beauty in the world. I am also interested in learning about photo editing.
- Completed my Chinese class. We performed Cinderella. I wrote a modern adaption of the play where instead of staying in an abusive household, Cinderella leaves and gets a job at a coffee shop. Fast foward 3 years later and she is the manager and going steady with the prince. Here is the [Cinderella-script](/post/cinderella)
