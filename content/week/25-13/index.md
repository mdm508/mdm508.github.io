Week 13 Range: March 24, 2025 â€“ March 30, 2025

## March 24 - March 30

### Monday
- I like keeping track of the year using the current week number.
- Lately I have been trying to learn the abacus. My goal this week is to improve my speed by continually adding the number 13.
- My 30th is coming up and it would feel great to publish that update before saturday. 
- I have woke up for 4am for 5 days in a row. I have been sleeping around 6 hours lately. It is hard to get up but I am always happy I got up later. 
- It seems like my ideal morning routine is 
    - make your bed
    - meditate
    - gym
    - program iOS

I am struggling to respect my new early bed time. Here I am at 9:46, 46 minutes late. I bought a 12 dollar doraemon alarm clock. You have to manually
set it each night. 

### Friday 

### Saturday
- Today I turned 30. I decided to go bowling with my dad, sister, her fiance, and Yush! I didn't like putting my fingers into the holes so I developed a new two handed technique. It is not very accurate but I am able to generate a lot of speed.
