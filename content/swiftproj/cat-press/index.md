## üìù Additional Notes  
The cat icon should be cat-themed. You can browse available options by visiting [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) and searching for ‚Äúcat‚Äù.

## ‚ú® Enhancements  
1. Replace the system icon with a photo of your own cat.  
2. Instead of printing "Meow" to the console, update a `Text` view to display it on screen.  
3. Add a tap counter that increases every time the cat meows!
