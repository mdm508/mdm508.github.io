<p>
While learning something in a book I want to look up more information
or have questions I want answered. This can be distracting from the reading,
stopping looking thing up, no guarantee on when I a coming back. 
</p>

<p>
And it might turn out I'm not really  interested in this. Just in that moment
I was. So I will try to delay research. Write down the question if you must
and see if its interesting a month from now. If so then research it.

During the day my mind has different speeds. I think it's best to stay
within the speed limit.

<div id="Re-centering-Going to slow"><h3 id="Going to slow" class="header"><a href="#Re-centering-Going to slow">Going to slow</a></h3></div>
<p>
If the mind is to slow and needs waking up try this
</p>
<ul>
<li>
somatic movement (dance around)

<li>


</ul>
<p>
If it needs slowing down (which is the more common situation) here are
some things to try
