## Live Coding Demos

Join me on zoom for a free 1 hour live coding demo. 
No coding experience required. Code along with me and dive into the world
of coding.

The demo will be offered on two dates. To join the meeting go to 
https://pwa.zoom.us/wc and enter the ID for the meeting you want to join.
I encourage you to [Preview the lesson](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/hoc-wescheme-intro/index.shtml#)
and start writting some code. See you at the demo!

## About me
Welocome to my webpage. I'm Matthew. I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge
of computer science with budding programmers and commited to helping them
achieve their goals.

I graduated with my B.S in Computer Science
from the University of California Irvine in 2018. During my school years, I 
tutored the introductory python series for the freshman class.  I have taught
for Girls Who Code and the Coder School in Irvine. Since 2020 I have offered
private tutoring via zoom. 


## Teaching Philosophy

At the core of my teaching philosophy are four key goals:

1. **Cultivate Problem-Solving Skills**: I am committed to nurturing students' problem-solving abilities, a cornerstone of success in the world of computer science and, well....life.

2. **Nurture Effective Study Habits**: I prioritize the development of study habits and encoure my students to create tiny habits to help them be consistent in their practice. 

3. **Inspire Confidence in Coding**: My mission is to instill confidence in students, enabling them to tackle intricate problems with code and transform their ideas into functional solutions.

4. **Learn with Enthusiasm**: Learning is most effective when it's enjoyable. I strive to create a dynamic and engaging learning environment, ensuring that lessons remain exciting and thought-provoking for my students.
