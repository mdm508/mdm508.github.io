## About Me
Welcome to my webpage. I'm Matthew. I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge
of computer science with budding programmers and committed to helping them
achieve their goals.

I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science
from the University of California, Irvine, in 2018. During my school years, I 
tutored the introductory Python series for the freshman class.  I have taught
for Girls Who Code and the Coder School in Irvine. Since 2020, I have offered
private tutoring via Zoom. 

## Teaching Philosophy

At the core of my teaching philosophy are four key goals:

1. **Cultivate Problem-Solving Skills**: I am committed to nurturing students' problem-solving abilities, a cornerstone of success in the world of computer science and, well... life.

2. **Nurture Effective Study Habits**: I prioritize the development of study habits and encourage my students to create tiny habits to help them be consistent in their practice. 

3. **Inspire Confidence in Coding**: My mission is to instill confidence in students, enabling them to tackle intricate problems with code and transform their ideas into functional solutions.

4. **Learn with Enthusiasm**: Learning is most effective when it's enjoyable. I strive to create a dynamic and engaging learning environment, ensuring that lessons remain exciting and thought-provoking for my students.
