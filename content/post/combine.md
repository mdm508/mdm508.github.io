## Introduction
There are a million articles on the Combine framework and the world doesn't
really need another one. That said, I learn best when I teach. Most of what
I say here is better said somewhere else. So, let me begin by citing my sources.

- [Understanding Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/)
- A Combine Kickstart, Daniel Steinberg


## What is the goal of Combine?
To provide a "unified publish and subscribe API for channelling and processing
asynchronous signals". 


*this article is still being written. I like to work with the garage door open
so I will publish this unfished draft anyway*
