* [Download Waabl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waabl/id1671041620). 

At the beggining of 2023 I started working on a Chinese Word of the Day
application in hopes of improving my iOS skills. A friend of mine
and I were sitting in a coffee shop and I asked him to name my app. He
came up with the name "Wobble".... but that was taken so I ended up having to 
name it [Waabl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waabl/id1671041620). 
It's a silly name devoid of meaning and yet I have ground fond of it.

Apple accepted Waabl to the all mighty app 
store during WWDC23. Getting the app published was a major milestone but I 
still have a long ways to go until I'm happy with it.

Someday I will post dev updates to this page.
