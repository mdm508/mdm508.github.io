I have a tendency to forget about bookmarks to useful websites so I am going
to be making a post that contains sites that I have found helpful in learning
Chinese.

## Chinese-Characters.org
This website has no advertisements despite the scam looking banner that I have
included below. You can learn about the etmology of Chinese characters. You can
also see the decomposition of the characters which aids in memorizing them.
