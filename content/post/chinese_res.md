I have a tendency to forget about bookmarks to useful websites so I am going
to be making a post that contains sites that I have found helpful in learning
Chinese.

## [Youglish](https://youglish.com/)
Search a vocabulary word or phrase and see examples on youtube.

## Chinese-Characters.org
You can learn about the etmology of Chinese characters. You can
also see the decomposition of the characters which aids in memorizing them.

<a href="http://chinese-characters.org/meaning/6/61C2.html">give it a try</a>

## Make Me a Hanzi
Search for characters by drawing them [Make me
  a hanzi](https://makemeahanzi.herokuapp.com/)
