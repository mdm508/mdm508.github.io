I have a tendency to forget about bookmark so I am going
to be making a post that contains sites that I have found useful or interesting.

## Learning Chinese
### [Youglish](https://youglish.com/)
Search a vocabulary word or phrase and see examples on youtube.

### Chinese-Characters.org
You can learn about the etmology of Chinese characters. You can
also see the decomposition of the characters which aids in memorizing them.

<a href="http://chinese-characters.org/meaning/6/61C2.html">give it a try</a>

### Make Me a Hanzi
Search for characters by drawing them [Make me
  a hanzi](https://makemeahanzi.herokuapp.com/)


## Language Aquisition
### [International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching](https://ijflt.com/)
Lots of free arcticles related to language learning. I find the articles
on this page motivating and interesting.
