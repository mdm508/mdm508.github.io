A while back I hosted a few coding demos online. I copy and pasted the original post below because I think these are still great introductory lessons that kids can use to help them break into the world of programming.


In the first half of the lesson, we will use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and in the second, [WeScheme](https://www.wescheme.org/).
- We will use the [Scratch Starter](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898666614) to make a simple snowflake-catching game.
- Then we will make cool shapes with the [WeScheme Starter](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/hoc-wescheme-intro/index.shtml#).
