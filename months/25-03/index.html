Here I am at 9:46, 46 minutes late. I bought a 12 dollar doraemon alarm clock. You have to manually
set it each night.</p><h3 id=friday>Friday</h3><ul><li>My Grandma stopped by the house and gave me two early birthday presents. A rasberry birthday cake and a pair of cross pens. She remembered that I was upset about loosing the pen my mom gave me! I was not expecting this gift at all but it made me so happy. I will not loose these pens (actually one of them is a mechanical pencil, the other a ball point pen). I won&rsquo;t loose them because I am never going to take them out of the house. They will remain in the same place at all times.</li></ul><h3 id=saturday>Saturday</h3><p>Today I turned 30. I decided to go bowling with my dad, sister, her fiance, and Yush! I didn&rsquo;t like putting my fingers into the holes so I developed a new two handed technique. It is not very accurate but I am able to generate a lot of speed.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_D1a1pBmXg?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><h2 id=march-31---april-6>March 31 - April 6</h2><h3 id=monday-1>Monday</h3><ul><li>Today I spent over 10 hours helping Yush plan a trip to Kyoto.</li><li>I created a custom google map to help reccomend interesting places based on what district she&rsquo;s in.</li><li>Turns out Kyoto has over 1600 temples!<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></li></ul><h3 id=tuesday>Tuesday</h3><p>I’ve been faithfully following my 4am, albeit insane, wake-up routine—but today, I needed a nap. The nap went on too long I actually felt more tired afterward.</p><h3 id=wednesday>Wednesday</h3><ul><li>My dreams were strange. Yush was in the garage in my office but I could not see her. She was a disembodied voice. It felt like the window was talking to me. She was reading math formulas to me in Chinese on a school broadcast system. At some other point I recall being chased by the police. They never caught me.</li><li>I went to the gym in the morning after meditation. I got there at 6am and still couldn&rsquo;t get a prime parking spot.</li><li>I&rsquo;m still procrastinating on iOS but I realized why <code>PersistenceController</code> was not being seen by my main app; I simply forgot to mark each of the files inside the <code>Persistence</code> framework as members of the <code>Persistence</code> target. I had assumed placing the files inside the framework`s folder was enough. Turns out you need to explicitally mark the source file as a member of the target.</li></ul><p><img src=target.png alt=img1></p><p><img src=target1.png alt=img2></p><h3 id=thursday>Thursday</h3><ul><li>I read for a few hours and realized that I was craving quality input. Reading was more enjoyable then watching TV or dumb videos online.</li><li>My office is pretty cold given the lack of insulation so I hung up some blankets to create a fort, in hopes to trap the warm air. I think its a failure so far.</li><li>Yush is in Taiwan so I have the house to myself for a month. I&rsquo;d love to use this time to improve my meditation practice. It is really quiet if I don&rsquo;t turn on the radio. I hope to give myself some time to enjoy the silence.</li></ul><h3 id=friday-1>Friday</h3><ul><li>I have still procrastinated on my morning iOS routine. After going to the gym at 530 I feel pretty tired. It might be prudent to go to the gym in the afternoon and protect those precious morning hours for focused work.</li><li>After the gym I stopped by St.Dunstan&rsquo;s Church to practice meditation. I was suprised to find the entire church adorned in purple. People in the front pews of the church was chanting something. I think it might be lent right now. It was a nice space to practice meditation in. It was like 3:00pm and kids were just getting out of class. A few of them went into the church with their mom to pray. In the 9 years I went to that school I cannot recall a single instance of going to Church after school with my mom to pray. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m really catholic anymore, I consider mysef Buddhist, but I decided to try praying and talking with Jesus nonetheless. I said &ldquo;hey, what&rsquo;s up, it&rsquo;s been a while&rdquo;. I was reminded of logging into Wii fitness last year and the screen said &ldquo;it has been 5,208 days since your last workout&rdquo;. I asked Jesus to help me focus, but then I felt bad because I realized that everytime I talked to him I was always asking for stuff. Even when I was a kid. So then I apolagized and told him &lsquo;actually its okay, I dont need anything, i&rsquo;m just saying, whats up". I love the idea of a guardian angel and for better or for worse Jesus has been burned into my memory and is probably the most iconic figure I can think of. So, I guess, I mine as well make use of that. I&rsquo;m trying to personify skillful versions of myself as a guardian angel and I think Jesus is an obvious canidate.</li><li>So in short, going to the Church when no one is there and there is no mass is quite relaxing. I love religous spaces and places of worship. It is also just weird to think that I sat in those same pews not too long ago.</li><li>Then I went to McDonald&rsquo;s bought an iced coffee for $0.99. Starbuck&rsquo;s is too expensive so I decided to read at McDonalds which is conveinently located accross from the church.</li><li>I&rsquo;m realizing that keeping a dream log is basically the same as keeping a real life log. Now I perhaps better understand Zhuangzi&rsquo;s piece about the butterfly.</li></ul><h3 id=weekend>Weekend</h3><ul><li>I finished <em>Source Code</em>!</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><em>List of Buddhist temples in Kyoto Prefecture</em>,
